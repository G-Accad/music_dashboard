Increasing my involvement in folk singing has gone hand-in-hand with increased attendance of Irish tune sessions and my  partner and I developing our own music and arrangements to perform at folk clubs and festivals.\nMy partner and I got together through a shared love of music and a desire to perform and he has been the catalyst to getting involved with local folk groups, which is something I had always wanted to do.","I was used to listening to folk songs on records and at school.","1) It looked fun, at times (!)  I'd always sung - rock / pop /jazz - but most of my life never British folk music. (I had sung Turkish and Greek folk songs occasionally before that, in their respective countries of origin.) 2. My (older) sister used to go to folk clubs with my Dad, and they knew local musicians. I used to sing along with the records at home so I think it seeded back then and weirdly germinated much later!  3) I saw that it *could* foster a warm and very social atmosphere compared to other forms of gatherings (eg non-folk open-mic nights). However, I had been to a folk night some years before and the opposite seemed to be true of that club. 4) I went to a folk night (Royal Traditions, Dungworth) originally to see Lady Maisery in their early days, primarily for their act, as I was interested in their harmony singing and arrangements. 5) The format of that night appealed to me. I had previously experienced and loathed (and still do) the 'singaround' one-by-one format, especially as a listener who did not want to sing. The 'sing if you want to' with no circle and with jolly 'house-songs' with words available was much more conducive to my joining in and eventually singing solo and/or leading chorus songs. \n6) I had a friend from a community choir, and also a neighbour, who were long-time folkies, and they encouraged and inspired me. \n7) I am interested in many kinds of music, and I seek out any musical genres and styles to stimulate my own (non-folk) musical creativity. \n8) Mental-ill health had destroyed my confidence to sing in public, and I saw the folk singing as the best way back to that - it took a while but it worked!","Enjoy the music, no need to read a score","Because family and friends were engaged in it","Found people singing in a local pub","I found it to be a music form that was much closer to real life as opposed to pop music which was starting to seem remote and inaccessible.","I have liked folk since I was a teenager and wanted to sing as a way of making music.","I used to sing four nights drunk as a joke to my friends, then I learnt a few more songs. And then a few more. I do also work in the music industry so they go hand in hand","Family tradition","I got into it at Forest School Camps.","A good a capella option","To join a choir, but I wasnâ€™t interested in singing classical or pop music","Connection with people\nEnjoy singing\nImprove mental health","As a teenager I started listening to Bob Dylan, The Pogues, The Dubliners, Woody Guthrie, Lonnie Donegan, other skiffle bands, Peter Bellamy &amp; The Young Tradition. I also taught myself guitar and banjo so it was good music to sing and play to myself. Easy structures.","I became interested in folk singing as a child because my next door neighbour's son (who I adored) played the guitar, and let me try it.  I then got a guitar for Christmas, aged 12, together with Folkways songbook '104 folk songs', later I got their '124 folk songs'  I spent my teens learning and singing them - all American songs, which seemed quite unusual and quaint.  I didn't much like the English folk revival at the time (Hated Steeleye Span on TOTP).  Much later (in my 40s) I started listening to singers like Lisa Knapp and Alasdair Roberts.  I really enjoy their interpretations of traditional songs. Walking past EFDSS one day I saw a poster of a bodybuilder adorned with Morris bells, saying 'Discover Your Inner Folk', advertising the Saturday singing workshop run by Sam Lee, so I joined and got back into singing - without the guitar. This time around I was influenced by heritage and culture more and got into source singers like Lizzie Higgins and Jeannie Robinson, and looking into what songs were collected where my family was from for example and learning them.  I love the stories in them.","I've always done it - ever since I was small! And now I'm 24 years old and I run a folk club in London.","I am more focussed on being an instrumentalist the singing is a collateral benefit. I was advised to do it to overcome public speaking nerves on a training course 25 years ago, it has served me well since.","Answer to previous Q of age 21 is when I started going to occasional folk festivals and concerts, but it was not until I was in my 40s that I started folk singing myself. That was after a few years in a community choir which did a few folk songs. I liked singing and wanted to do more, and knew I liked folk songs, so I started folk singing classes at Sage Gateshead.","I liked the songs. Seemed like fun and my friends were into it too.",null,"I was looking for a ceilidh club and accidentally found a folk choir","I liked listening to folk music, and while i wanted to be in a choir i didnâ€™t want to sing songs in a language I didnâ€™t understand or for a religion i donâ€™t believe in.

I started to gain confidence singing in public - had been singing several years on car journeys!","I'd got interested in folk music - often American - at school but trips to local folk clubs revealed trad material from the UK and I thought, I'd like to have a go at that","Because the old songs resonate with me, and I don't like rap/pop/rock much.","I didn't really, my Dad and his family members sang - so I did too.","I grew up with it, enjoy the feeling of being amongst people singing and wanted to be able to initiate singing like I experienced.","It was something I could do with my daughter","I started Morris dancing &amp; introduced to folk music that way.","I like to sing with friends, was going to sessions anyway playing the bodhran","I am a morris dancer, it goes along with that.","everyone else was joining in","Traditional music and song at family events","I like it","There's a few reasons. I love the kinds of stories involved, they are so emotionally direct and occasionally the phrasing really catches your breath. I like the connection to different sorts of lives to mine (I'm not nostalgic about the rural idyllic past though, I just mean in a broad sense lives from the past, working class lives of the past and so on). I love the emotional connection: singing rude or silly songs that make people laugh, heartbreak songs that make people cry, union songs that help people channel anger or frustration. And I also love the feeling of connection and community that comes from singing choruses together. Finally, I like how I can put it all on the line when I sing. Life is necessarily emotionally restrained, or emotions are put across in factual terms. But when you sing a song, it can be a conduit to something bigger. As it happens, I have Bipolar II Disorder and I feel like I can really draw on the extremes that I experienced before getting diagnosed and getting well, for example.","No idea","Pleasure","Suits my quality of voice and come originally from an area of the South East where Folk music was an integral part of community life","My dad used to play trad folk music on a night when I was young and I could hear him play and sing downstairs as I feel asleep upstairs. When I grew older it was a bonding point for me and my dad, talking about the stories behind the songs he sung. We would them go to folk club together when I was 16/17 and sing and play together - going out most nights to folk clubs around the country.

I liked the music very much and I liked the idea that it was relatively easy to enter and be accepted at a fairly low level of accomplishment, but that there was plenty of headroom to progress. I liked the inclusivity and \"Bohemian-ness\"","I found I really enjoyed it, musically, lyrically and performance wise.","I started getting into folk music as a teenage violinist because there were really good folk musicians at my school. I was too shy to join in with them, but I started playing folk fiddle at home, and listening to folk albums. I came across Eliza Carthy's music and loved her voice for it's unaffectedness, and how low it was - I have a very low voice for a woman and always felt self-conscious growing up because it didn't sound like any of my peers.

There are, however, many reasons why that is the case, which are not to do with the format. The pub, and even the layout of the pub, are factors, as are the regulars and their love of the place and the club. Interestingly, I have introduced friends to that environment, some unconfident at singing and at first new to folk music, and they have been converted. I would stress though, that there are aspects of folk singing in clubs that would be anathema to many people who are not already into folk music, and even at Royal Traditions, these would put people off. I am not suggesting that a 'true' traditional folk night should be censored or artificially tailored. However, I would dearly like to see the folk singing format of Royal Traditions and its inclusive ethos, the 'sing if you want to but no pressure', the rousing chorus house songs (which encourage more of the same), plus a live act to draw people in, replicated elsewhere with a more diverse audience and with less reliance on the breadth of the traditional (mainly white British) / folk revival / received wisdom/knowledge/folk police/'quasi-academic knowledge and memory-requirements'. I love Royal Traditions but I would propose that the format could be replicated elsewhere with four separate but not mutually exclusive suggestions. These, in addition to a traditional but innovative English folk club like Royal Traditions, would be my ideals. 1) I really believe that the format could be trialled / adapted in a suitable venue (Sheffield would be good!) to include folk music from ethnic minority groups and people who have migrated to the UK. This would need careful planning and monitoring (and an interesting set of house songs!) but I think it could be a goer. This would mean a more revolving door of house songs, and some help and transliterations of the songs, but I think that would be a fascinating project, and one which might receive funding btw :)\n2) Fun. Escapism. Chorus songs. Not everyone wants to sing a solo but they will sing if there is enough noise. There is a reason why Shanties took off in the lockdowns globally, and also why the chorus songs and 'joiny-in-ones' at folk clubs are so popular. Eliza Carthy in her Twitter musings on what is folk points to community-wide songs - and what are they these days? As she points out, they are football chants and pub singalong faves, from Fairytale of New York, to (!) Delila, to Hey Jude. I was in a theatre show with Hey Jude as the last song, and you have the community singing experience. I recall a memorable theatre singalong Sound of Music too! I'm not suggesting that these should be part of the diversity as mentioned above (but come to think of it, perhaps Hey Jude would be a way of integration?) - I digress. My point here is a serious one. The solo English folk ballads, and more modern political or potentially depressing songs are important and interesting, and my suggestion above in point one would mean that such serious and 'blues' folk songs from around the world should not be discouraged. But - I often have heard songs (even at Royal Traditions) that are dreadfully depressing, and unremitting in their misogyny, their tales of murder, death, infanticide, rape, racism, colonialism, imperialism, impotence, etc, and I could go on.. I see much of this differently as a folk outsider. At a gig at which the group gleefully said 'another (the 7th?) song about death!' I turned to a fellow audience member who had also recently lost his father and said 'this is too much for me', and he agreed. I mention this also in connection with my first point above. I know someone who is a drama therapist for torture victims. Many folk songs would not be appropriate. But apart from that, I have had success with creating the jolly 'Hey Jude' atmosphere in public and elsewhere with jolly shanty and chorus songs, including the Royal Trads house songs. Jolly chorus and joiny-in songs with the words really work for all! As an ex- (TEFL/EAP) English teacher, I'd say these would work with ESL teachers who work with migrants and refugees. \n3) A folk club for all ethnicities, without any of the caveats above. Sort of contradicting myself massively, but I think it is imperative that a separate initiative should be made to capture all of the true folk music in the UK right now, whether it is jolly, trad or not. Who is archiving now? The UK of 2023 should be recorded. I'll be provocative now. You have funding, and you say you will go to Thailand and Vietnam, which I support, but do spend your funding on what is here! Who is capturing it? Who is collecting?\n4) Could folk music clubs (at least to occasional city centre / Christmas sings) blend to Eliza's wide definition of folk sings? I provided song sheets for trad Derbyshire / Yorkshire carols in a local pub but mixed with well-known carols. It worked. I honestly think there is a future there. It is all folk, after all\n\n\n\n","Outdoors in a group","I like when people know a bit of music so we are on the same level","Invite only traditional sing","A quiet room full of people who are listening to the performers and not treating them as simply background music.","Among friends in a bar.","In a pub (that's no too loud/rowdy but some atmosphere) with a group that's varied in age and diverse - pretty relaxed and all sat around singing along with each other","Among a relaxed group of like-minded people","Inclusive singaround with diverse leaders and lots of chorus songs.","Cecil Sharp House Choir","Folk club or pub","Friendly.

For example, in the last two months, I have been 'serenaded' at a folk club by a man during a love song, and told by another at a session that if it had been 'a competition for the best looking performer you would have won, although the standard IS pretty low I suppose'. \n\nHowever, while I am capable of dealing with these situations, in both instances other male attendees have also indicated that this is unacceptable (â€˜this is why women donâ€™t come to folk clubsâ€™), and I think this is very positive - this might not have happened 10 years ago.\n\nWhile the folk tradition includes original songs as well as traditional, there is resistance in attitudes to new material, which can sit paradoxically alongside a reverence for John Martyn and Richard Thompson etc. \n\nAdditionally, when I have performed my own songs at folk clubs or sessions, other attendees have at times explained the subject matter to me, going so far as to explain my own local history to me, despite not being from my area. \n\nA lot of assumptions and generalisations are made, and people and their songs are judged to be wanting and disregarded. A few years ago I wrote a song from the point of view of a Victorian Methodist missionary who died in the Gambia, based on a true story I had across which had saddened and enraged me. When I first performed it, a regular at my folk club folded his arms and glowered and sighed very loudly all the way through, refusing to engage because he was an atheist (even though if he had actually listened, heâ€™d have realised it was highly critical!).  \n\nI've seen similar instances happen over the years to other people, and don't believe my experience is an is an isolated one. I once saw a young and precocious but talented American musician perform â€˜Johnny Jump Upâ€™ with a very exaggerated Irish accent, seeking inelegantly to ham up an already hammy song, and many members of the folk club collectively got up and went to the bar, speaking very loudly in order to drown out the music. I felt bad for the musician as he hadnâ€™t meant to cause offence and there might have been other ways of dealing with it. \n\nA particular issue which I have personally struggled with has been the attitude to class amongst folk singers, which I have felt very often over my time at folk singing events. I am from a privileged family and was privately educated, and while I am politically left-leaning, I have often felt that it is important to keep deliberately quiet about my background in order not to reveal that I shouldnâ€™t really be there, despite my lifelong passion for the art form. The songs, explanations and heckles are often stridently socialist with little nuance, and while no one is deliberately targeting me, I often feel uncomfortable when faced with the blanket â€˜us and themâ€™ standpoint.  \n",null,null,null,"Throat problems..

I've witnessed too many people be upset or offended when the person causing offence has literally no idea that they've done anything wrong, and sometimes it feels a bit over the top and like the offended person is going out of their way to find offence in what has been said or done.",null,"I think folk singing in England is perceived differently to English folk singing. \nI think different communities will continue to perform their own music's, without necessarily wanting to become part of 'English folk singing, even though they are taking part in folk singing in England.","I can absolutely see why non-white people might feel uncomfortable in a folk singing context. I would say that quite a few people I have interacted with would not consider themselves racist but would also sing racist songs and argue that they should still be able to do that. But it's not really for me to say how non-white people feel or don't feel. I will say that as a woman a whole lot of folk songs are unpleasant about women but I have to get over that to participate in folk singing.","Getting suitable venues for folk clubs are getting harder as time goes on.","I am getting on a bit so have little problem with nerves or confidence.","I learnt folk song and dance in school, but I don't think that happens much now, especially in less able students.

But I guess it's important to regonise that, despite the common narrative,  there is not \"a great Folk Scene in Sheffield!\" - there are a number of overlapping circles of acoustic song sessions in Sheffield pubs that are very different in the repertoires one is likely to hear at them. Lots of people go to \"folk sessions\" who know NOTHING about traditional English folk song, and would find unaccompanied singing \"WEIRD!\" some of us dip our toes on several different pools sometimes, some never do, they stick with what's familiar to them and their mates. We have an absurdly large number of well-known - in certain circles - singers of \"English folk songs\" in Sheffield, whose names are totally unknown to I don't know how many people who may go to their sort of folk session in different pubs two or three times every week. People who wouldn't deam of going to, say Whitby Folk Week, or who wouldn't dream of stopping to watch a Morris side or Sword Dance team in Barker's Pool for even a minute! I hope you at the University are aware of that. I said there are a number of different overlapping \"folk\" song session circles, but the overlap can be very slight, I think, for I've no idea how many participants. Comfort Zones are a definite phenomenon.","No",null,"I have been singing folk song for several decades now and I donâ€™t think there has ever been so much sensitivity around what is sung and who by before. \n I tend to sing traditional songs so perhaps I feel it more than most! Repertoires have been reduced and there has been a lot of self censorship. I think the folk community is more diverse but not perhaps the canon of song sung which are in danger of being whittled down to a narrow band width of beige! It is perhaps why shanties seem more popular than ever; few seem to find offence with jolly songs about the sea.","Folk needs more people of color as well as better disability access","I have always found singing in sessions to be inclusive, from my first exposure to it in the 80s. Poor singers often improve with time. I have known people in wheel chairs or groups of blind people being totally accepted. The colour of a person's skin has never impacted on the singing. Foreign languages are always accepted, by a native speaker or otherwise.","No","No thank you.",null,"No","Many songs are particular to a place or event.

My main concern is that the scene as a whole is not outward looking enough. Events are often held in back rooms or upstairs rooms which means that the general public have very little exposure to the music. We can often be in our own comfortable 'bubble', which has helped to hugely raise standards, but we end up just playing to each other. The festival fringe is a great example of how to reach a broader audience with events in pubs, restaurants, the Town Square and a Morris procession. Most local people think that is the festival and don't come to the site to see the concerts, but still greatly enjoy and appreciate the events. Building bridges between those worlds is one of the greatest challenges.","Find the racism in some Morris dance groups unfortunate. I emphasise some.

I would hope that this keeps the sessions open to people from all groups, but I have noted that attendees tend to be almost exclusively white and with English as a native language even though from time to time we sing songs in other languages. It would be good if we could encourage people from other national or ethnic backgrounds to take part, not only for their benefit but for the benefit of those already involved.","I'm a middle aged white man so I can do pretty much whatever I want. I don't think my experience is that relevant. But since you ask, I believe the majority of people involved in folk music in the UK intend to be inclusive, and that the ideological background of the scene is progressive, internationalist and anti-racist. I have watched us fall short of that goal on occasion, mostly by accident or through ignorance. Still and all, my heart swells with pride for the way my parents' generation stood against fascism and racism, and for the way me and mine have tried to live up to their example and for the way my children and their peers have taken up that baton.","I think most of these things have been covered.",null,"No. Anyone can attend these events.

I strongly believe that we should nurture both the old and the new folk songs.",null,"I find most explicitly folk events I go to in London are generally attended by old white and largely straight lefties who sing songs to match. I have also taken part in a regular event run and attended by younger people - still mainly white, but maybe more diverse in terms of sexuality (I'm guessing, didn't ask) - but there's not a lot of crossover between the age groups. You don't see many people who aren't white at folk events, though I have one friend who probably identifies as black (haven't asked him) who runs a singaround I occasionally attend and there are one or two who come to the local singarounds. I think people who sing tend to do it with people they feel they have some kind of understanding with, so that they feel safe to open up. Singing is exposing. There's also the question of what counts as \"folk\", which varies quite a lot. A group dominated by men (and the occasional woman) with guitars playing American songs can be off-putting if, like me, you're a woman who prefers to sing tradtional English and French songs acapella. That said, they're usually ok about it, if not massively enthusiastic.","I think ability levels is a really interesting one. We donâ€™t have a large legacy of training young people up in the tradition in this country and there are a lot of new starters which makes for interesting dynamics of who sessions etc are for and how to structure them","Are you really limiting this to England? I sing in Cornwall, Wales and Ireland regularly, and intend to visit Scotland again soon. The experience is fairly similar; singers welcome other singers.","It is interesting that locally folk clubs tend to be full of older people.  As a musical event, younger musicians are acceptable to watch as a concert, rather than joining a folk club or even a Shout! just happening.  Music isnâ€™t taught in schools as it used to be, a compulsory group lesson not just after school.  However traditions with folk music as a part of the whole event, like Padstow Obby Oss, are acceptable to all the population and the schools and youngsters have their own part of that.  Visitors can watch and follow but only local families can be the leaders. \nWe need to accept we are all individuals and unique in our view of the world we live in.  We do not need to be labelled and put into groups to share the power of singing together.  Folk sing about joyous things like working together and singing sea shanties to get the work done, as well as understanding the trials and tribulations of everyday survival, like the song that described the freedom of slaves in south USA, who could learn the song Follow the Drinking Gourd and do everything it describes, to follow the Big Dipper constellation North to escape, because it shone by Polaris. Folk music brings equity, where all folk are important because we all enjoy and endure.","I am interested in the use of the phrase a \"good singer\" in one of your questions, without any reference to what the phrase may mean. What a \"good singer\" is needs to be defined. Some people would think that it refers to voice quality or being in tune and others would focus on the ability to communicate the content.","I generally only sing while in Cornwall at clubs.  In New Zealand I only sing on radio","The singing sessions and folk clubs I've attended over the years are almost without fail exclusively white. \nAnother factor is that so many folk singing sessions are held in pubs. I really like pubs but don't like spending loads of time in them, especially during an afternoon session when it's bright outside and quite dim in the pub. I would go to far more sessions if some were held perhaps in cafes or small community halls etc now and then, where you can see the daylight outside! This might also encourage a wider audience.",null,"I donâ€™t sing in England. I sing in Cornwall and I am Cornish which is an officially recognised National Minority with UK Govt commitments to protect and promote its culture, heritage and language.

If you go to a festival though,for example Cropredy ( organised by Fairport Convention) the audience ranges from babies through young people and families to the over 80s and includes many disabled participants roaming the festival field in electric buggies  etc. Also,defining folk is increasingly tricky. because todays pop song can be a folk song if it lasts for a long time and words get modified and adapted over time with new verses added etc .And there are many writers and singers who tell stories and poems . they don't just sing.

In our shanty group it was suggested that the song â€œ Youâ€™ll never make a sailor if your allâ€™s hang lowâ€ be included in the repertoire. Some of the verses of which could be deemed questionable by certain people and has yet to be sung by the group in â€œpoliteâ€ company.

There are also songs about being crippled or blind or whatever which may make some uncomfortable.","I was a very latecomer to singing/folksinging, which came about due to a life-changing experience, and came to realise whad a wondrous experience it was. Folksinging is a minority activity, in England,  more so in Wales because of historical reasons,  but has widespread appeal, evidenced by numbers that attend folk festivals and come to listen at sessions. Sadly, something I frequently hear from people is that they can't sing, which is nonsensical. Everybody can sing, but some can sing better than others, like any other activity, but does require to be practised to improve.\nOne of the problems folksinging has, I think, is that it is regarded as an 'oldies' activity, and so appeal to the younger generation. How you change this perception, I do not know. There is greater competition from other music forms, but making folksinging a more mainstream activity for all, via schools and regional/national media might change this perception.\nFolksinging  is a very social activity,  has definite health benefits not universally recognised. In my case it has reinforced my cultural identity and continues to give great pleasure",null,"Sessions are very often dominated by groups of older white men in the back rooms of pubs, who play/sing the same stuff every time, that they know really well. it can be difficult to try to break through that clique  and do something different.

It's great for people who are immune compromised and cautious about face to face situations, and great for those who would struggle to physically get to events.  For me, I've accessed folk clubs over 200 miles away that have been attended by people all around the world, which is wonderful and introduces us to songs we might not have heard before.   The folk community seems to have really widened in this respect, which is a really positive thing.    Inclusion is interesting. I can only speak about being female in what can be a very male environment at times. I was told growing up, for example, that 'there's no such thing as ladies morris'.  Shanty groups tend to be male, and men tend to dominate pub sessions with loud bawdy songs. It can be tricky to infiltrate as a female.  I think it's one of the reasons I choose to sing songs from the women's point of view, the work they've done, and the lives they live - to be their voice, because history has typically been told from the man's view.   I'm conscious that the folk world tends to be very white too. I can think of one younger person who is not (Cohen Brathwaite - Kilcoyne) who is flying the flag and representation for people of colour.    I've once seen someone mocked for how they performed in a pub session. My mum spotted that they were likely autistic and spoke with them afterwards (they were). She then berated the people who'd been rude, and set them straight!  Although people can be really encouraging and lovely, I've also heard way too many adults be bitchy about other people at folk events. There's gossip, and people not speaking to others, and comments to one side, which does put me off.","Folk music and folk singing are almost inexhaustable subjects for discussion, and full marks to you for having a go.

Pubs cannot afford to instal lifts!\n\nSome clubs are more political than others. This can be devisive. Some clubs have  a definition of folk music as very unaccompanied.

This has taught me to be very selective with subject matter and indeed where I sing. I admit I often, chicken out, if I feel the occasion isn't right. \nI also think that most pub session attendees who come along usually with a guitar often see a singer as something to endure, before they can get back to strumming. \nPure musicians too, e.g. fiddlers can rarely listen, they get too engrossed in their own instrument to have any interest in words. I've experienced musicians deciding not to attend sessions because waiting for their turn, on a round the room event was too long. By the same token they were unwilling to play a simple chord or two as an in between verse accompaniment to an otherwise acapella song.\nIMO there is definitely a divide between those who sing, and those who play and sing, however unsuccessfully that may be.","My experience of singing at folk songs has opened new doors for me. \nI now sing-in 2 choirs  One a choral at the cathedral and church singing in parts . \nPlus my helping in the guitar group .","Some Folk clubs can be somewhat cool towards strangers.","I think there is a big gap between, on the one hand, clubs being welcoming to new/younger members and being aware of physical access issues and, on the other, being alert to issues around ethnicity and LGBTQ+. This is partly a generational thing. I think some clubs are so unused to seeing younger people that they don't get that younger people are likely to be much less tolerant of attitudes that might be viewed as (or actually are) discriminatory. To be honest I think this is only resolvable by younger people having their own clubs, in most cases anyway.","Well, the obvious thing that springs to mind is that nearly everyone I know from folk circles and almost everyone I've ever met or heard sing at a club has been white.

That might reflect overall attendance (which would raise questions in itself), but I also have the sense that in couples who come to the club, it's more common for female partners to say 'I don't sing' than male partners. On reflection, of the two clubs I belong to, I'd say that the one with a sing around format attracts more singing from women than does the one where we song from the stage - and I can think of particular women I know to be experienced singers who will generally say 'no thanks' when offered a stage-based 'floor spot'\nI hadn't previously given thought to something I'm pretty sure to be the case - that the overwhelming majority of people I know attending singing events would identify as 'straight'  In addition, I know of only two people associated with clubs and events I've been familiar with over the years who've transitioned.",null,"No","Mostly older white people taking part.

I think there might be a bit of a gap between those who frequent folk clubs who tend to be older and those who mostly go to gigs/festivals who tend to be younger, although there is a lot of crossover.  A 'club' sort of implies a closed group that you have to be a member of, so in a way it feels it's not the right term for it.  Don't know what is though.  And young people are busy discovering what they like so are probably less 'regular' in attendance at specific things.  I've noticed that lots of younger people I've met who are into folk, have got into it through their parents.  Just like the folk dynasties of Waterson/Carthy, Kerr, etc there seem to be many less famous folk 'families' around.  Also there's quite a movement around environmental/the land that seems to align with the folk ethos  - lots of folk songs about nature and the land and protest.  e.g. Right to Roam  is active about the right to camp on Dartmoor and that links back to Ewan MacColl being at the Kinder Scout mass trespass back in the day....what goes around comes around.\n\n","I think aging demographics at countryside folk festivals such as Sidmouth are a bit of a problem - it makes it hard to feel like you belong when you're one of the only young adults there.

But it is nearly always a rewarding experience, new songs, tunes ideas etc. The feeling of community regardless of location is always rewarding. Shame so many venues are closing and it is so hard to find out about them when new to an area.","As a middle aged white male, most of the potential barriers to inclusion don't tend to apply to me, but I recognise that there are barriers to others, and I think it is very important that folk singing is inclusive and open to all.","I think that the folk clubs that sprung from the so called revival in the 1960s were probably a temporary 1 to 1.5 generation phenomenon. They certainly don't have much in common with the environments in which folk song existed in the previous couple of hundred years. They worked for a particular set of social circumstances, but society has moved on more than your average folk club. Among their strengths were the importance of active participation in the music and the sense of community for the attendees. Among their weaknesses was a tendency to a certain small c conservatism in the way they continued to operate, a failure to realise how the wider public might see them.\n\nThe rise of the festivals has done much to promote the notion of professionalism amongst performers, but maybe at the same time by creating events that are in many ways similar to other professional entertainment industry events, they have not been as successful at developing active participation in singing. Their scale also tends toward focusing on bands rather than solo performers.\n\nThere is a real need for much more diversity in the ways and places that people can sing. In particular in convivial, smaller scale, inclusive, community type settings that encourage people to participate and also to practise and get better.",null,null,"My experience has been largely positive, apart perhaps from an small, older male contingent who can make folk clubs feel cliquey, and who can be patronising - albeit unintended - to younger particularly female- singers.",null,"No","Folk singing groups are often small, vary in attendance numbers from session to session  and found in local communities ....unfortunately they often cannot afford the cost of hiring the local community halls and rooms and rely quite a lot on pubs with spare room on the ground floor to accomodate.",null,null,"Creating lovely inclusive spaces for cherished music is fine, but I believe that getting out into public spaces not as an evangelist but making our folk music normal in a public session, singing in the pub, community event even alongside other music in a way to share ownership of the sings as a normal community asset","A great deal of folk music is, of its nature, historically based, and from the perspective is very white-British centric.
