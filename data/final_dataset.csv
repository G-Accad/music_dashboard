All the violence against women stuff is dodgy, but it *is* apart of the tradition, and can be OK if given a context. Happy murder singalongs, though, like Banks of the Ohio, are bad.

(We had a rule 'No Singing At Mealtimes' though). We learnt to sing at school, from the BBC Singing Together (I think it was called), and from one teacher in particular who taught us folk songs as 'writing practice'. As a teenager I veered towards listening to pop songs, but I encountered folk songs at a rather hippyish venue I attended and again at uni, where communal singing was a part of a walking group I belonged to.

Otherwise, I think my preference is for songs that evoke an emotional response in me, that I can feel as I sing them - there's one ballad I sing where I find myself wondering whether the heroine will be rescued in time even as I sing it.","Yes","There was an extremely vulgar song, to the point of obscenity, (they just called it 'The Yogi Bear Song') that one of the pub's staff used to sing at Towersey - it conjured up a lot of very unpleasant images in my mind that were hard to get rid of, and the presence of small children was no deterrence.
I was also once present when a version of 'Two Magicians' was sung that was introduced as a song with 'a happy ending' (ie the rapist was successful); sitting in a largely male audience while they roared out ""Bide, lady, bide / there's nowhere you can hide / the lusty smith will be your love / and he will lay your pride"" was a horrible experience (I'm shaking as I type) particularly when you've been in the position of being pursued through dark streets and finding that every possible refuge is actually just a trap. I was rescued as it happens, but I'm glad I've never heard that version again and would walk out if I did.
  I do walk out if anyone starts 'The Rawtenstall Annual Fair' - a nasty song about shows run by men where women are the exhibits, mostly being exposed and humiliated (even when they are supposedly customers) for the entertainment of men.","Yes","None","Yes","At sessions without a leader, turns are dominated by cliques, particularly of instrumentalists - they can bag the next slot just by striking up a few chords and pass the turns around among themselves. There's no real chance of an unaccompanied singer getting a turn, in fact they tend to assume that if you were a singer you would have brought your guitar.
Smoking used to be a huge problem, but thankfully isn't any more - it used to be really hard to sing with your throat and lungs full of smoke.

But when I could get out to festivals, being part of the singaround crowd always meant that I belonged, even when I went on my own; wherever there was a singaround, I would be accepted, and at home, and there would probably be people I knew - even if I didn't at the start, I would by the end.

And I've not sung it out yet, but I'm toying with a new tune for The Salley Gardens because the usual tune is SO blended with the words that I feel the words are heard in a comfortable haze, subsumed with the tune as one familiar old chestnut, such that they're never HEARD as the WORDS a poet crafted from his own ponderings, once upon a time.

The upside of this can be that sometimes I sing something ""from the heart"" that is not at all what they're used to - and they love it, and say so. Communications have been successful!

I take the view that most people understand these songs come from a different era and that if one is sensitive in the delivery then they are generally well recieved. You canâ€™t please everyone after all and if someone has a problem with a song that has been sung then itâ€™s generally their problem isnâ€™t it?

Folkies are generally reasonably minded folk with an open mind and welcoming, etc. Personally if I feel a session is too male heavy I will often give a nod to a female singer to give us a song and will go out of my way to try and get younger members to join in. I resent it when the same consideration is not given to everyone just for the sake of appealing to the PC brigade. Minority politics can be quite distorting and one needs to consider the majority of those in a session or audience first; we do live in a democracy after all.","I have been singing folk song for several decades now and I donâ€™t think there has ever been so much sensitivity around what is sung and who by before. 
 I tend to sing traditional songs so perhaps I feel it more than most! Repertoires have been reduced and there has been a lot of self censorship. I think the folk community is more diverse but not perhaps the canon of song sung which are in danger of being whittled down to a narrow band width of beige!

The group met monthly in pubs around the area, in the bar or lounge, not a back room. Most singers were unaccompanied but it was a personal choice if people wanted to accompany themselves or sing as a small group and was unamplified. The only requirement was that the landlord turned off any background music. There was generally a favorable reaction from members of the public who would join in when they realised that it was normal and we had many good comments such as 'I didn't know people still did this' and sometimes wanted to sing a song themselves.

My main concern is that the scene as a whole is not outward looking enough. Events are often held in back rooms or upstairs rooms which means that the general public have very little exposure to the music. We can often be in our own comfortable 'bubble', which has helped to hugely raise standards, but we end up just playing to each other. The festival fringe is a great example of how to reach a broader audience with events in pubs, restaurants, the Town Square and a Morris procession. Most local people think that is the festival and don't come to the site to see the concerts, but still greatly enjoy and appreciate the events.

Either on the same evening, or around the same time, I smiled at another woman singer as we passed each other in the (same) pub and she blanked me. To be honest, I think singers are usually supportive and encouraging of each other - but not always ...

I'd probably be able to shrug it off now, but I was much younger then and more ""sensitive"" perhaps.
And in general, unless you're known to the people running the session, or it's a folk club in which the singaround is more organised, it can be harder for unaccompanied singers to make their contribution.

I have an interest in the origin, the history of songs, and songs which record or are linked to historical events. In my Welsh repertoire , after a long search, I discovered recently a version of the traditional 'CÃ¢n y Melinydd' (Miller'sSong) adapted as a protest song against conscription of agricultural labouers into the military to meet shortfall in troops during the American War of Independence, 1775-83, that had serious impact on the rural economy of Wales.","Yes","A song about masturbation performed at the beginning of an organised  singaround in a pub.

Folksinging is a minority activity, in England,  more so in Wales because of historical reasons,  but has widespread appeal, evidenced by numbers that attend folk festivals and come to listen at sessions. Sadly, something I frequently hear from people is that they can't sing, which is nonsensical. Everybody can sing, but some can sing better than others, like any other activity, but does require to be practised to improve.
One of the problems folksinging has, I think, is that it is regarded as an 'oldies' activity, and so appeal to the younger generation. How you change this perception, I do not know. There is greater competition from other music forms, but making folksinging a more mainstream activity for all, via schools and regional/national media might change this perception.

Some songs can also have misogynist themes and topics. People singing songs in exaggerated accents which are not their own can also jar. 

There can be a multitude of reasons, however - for example, some newcomers don't realise it's OK to change the words to these and try to honour the tradition against their better judgement, and some people don't realise that songs which might have been OK to sing 5 years ago are no longer welcome. I think it needs to be addressed, but understanding and a sensitive approach is important.","No","None","Yes","Certain folk clubs in particular can be a little cliquey, and it can take time to infiltrate them. 

While the extensive knowledge that some attendees possess is invaluable, and a fantastic reason to attend folk singing events, there can be a downside in that many of the same individuals seem to enjoy the status they possess and can be resistant to innovation, originality and change, and this can come across as rude and excluding. For example, if a phrase is sung with a different cadence to the perceived â€˜rightâ€™ one (e.g. the third verse of Raglan Road), that can be enough for people to seize upon it and loudly complain.

While the 'know-all' tendencies can easily come from both men and women, some of the specific off-putting behaviour does generally tend to come from men.

As a 40 year old woman who has been singing folk songs in public for the last 15 years, I have generally been several decades years younger than most of the other performers, the majority of them men. I have undoubtedly been overly praised as a result of this, but I have also been singled out in an unwelcome manner at times. For example, in the last two months, I have been 'serenaded' at a folk club by a man during a love song, and told by another at a session that if it had been 'a competition for the best looking performer you would have won, although the standard IS pretty low I suppose'. 

However, while I am capable of dealing with these situations, in both instances other male attendees have also indicated that this is unacceptable (â€˜this is why women donâ€™t come to folk clubsâ€™), and I think this is very positive - this might not have happened 10 years ago.

While the folk tradition includes original songs as well as traditional, there is resistance in attitudes to new material, which can sit paradoxically alongside a reverence for John Martyn and Richard Thompson etc. 

Additionally, when I have performed my own songs at folk clubs or sessions, other attendees have at times explained the subject matter to me, going so far as to explain my own local history to me, despite not being from my area. 

A lot of assumptions and generalisations are made, and people and their songs are judged to be wanting and disregarded. A few years ago I wrote a song from the point of view of a Victorian Methodist missionary who died in the Gambia, based on a true story I had across which had saddened and enraged me. When I first performed it, a regular at my folk club folded his arms and glowered and sighed very loudly all the way through, refusing to engage because he was an atheist (even though if he had actually listened, heâ€™d have realised it was highly critical!).  

I've seen similar instances happen over the years to other people, and don't believe my experience is an is an isolated one. I once saw a young and precocious but talented American musician perform â€˜Johnny Jump Upâ€™ with a very exaggerated Irish accent, seeking inelegantly to ham up an already hammy song, and many members of the folk club collectively got up and went to the bar, speaking very loudly in order to drown out the music. I felt bad for the musician as he hadnâ€™t meant to cause offence and there might have been other ways of dealing with it. 

A particular issue which I have personally struggled with has been the attitude to class amongst folk singers, which I have felt very often over my time at folk singing events. I am from a privileged family and was privately educated, and while I am politically left-leaning, I have often felt that it is important to keep deliberately quiet about my background in order not to reveal that I shouldnâ€™t really be there, despite my lifelong passion for the art form. The songs, explanations and heckles are often stridently socialist with little nuance, and while no one is deliberately targeting me, I often feel uncomfortable when faced with the blanket â€˜us and themâ€™ standpoint.

These would be informal evenings in the pub; everyone would dress up and entertain each other with 'turns'; songs, music, dancing, readings, etc. In 2018? a group of us started these up again in a community venue in Ennerdale and they run every other month, a bit like an open mic but very informal and everyone is limited to 5 minutes. The 'turns' are interspersed with songs from the hosting community choir. In 2020 these went to Zoom and as a result, we had people joining from all over the world, doing their turn in their living rooms. Now we run it as a both Room and Zoom, and we have turns which are from the room and from the zoomers. (After that all the roomers go to the community pub and carry on a singing session). These Merry Neets have become really popular, and the regulars create and practice their turn especially for them, leading to some fabulous creativity. They aren't purely 'folk song' events, but that is the general flavour. https://www.facebook.com/events/167039362799575

Also, near here there is a tiny (deconsecrated) church up on the fell with lovely acoustics, which my singing group began to use as a concert venue last year, within a format of us hosting and guest spots. There is no power or facilities, so the audience have to bring cushions, flasks, lanterns. Unfortunately it is only accessible by foot. I have written a spoken word piece which incorporates folk songs for May Day which we will perform there, followed by guest spots. https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/spirit-of-may-a-celebratory-performance-with-music-and-storytelling-tickets-602625979527?aff=esfb&utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&utm-medium=discovery&utm-source=fb&utm-term=listing&fbclid=IwAR0At5iUTOrL8dhM6b8sci1um8I4QK5knr9roMLAr5u3xPtDAAcpeP-pS-c

It's opened up opportunities to sing with people right around the world. It's great for people who are immune compromised and cautious about face to face situations, and great for those who would struggle to physically get to events.  For me, I've accessed folk clubs over 200 miles away that have been attended by people all around the world, which is wonderful and introduces us to songs we might not have heard before.   The folk community seems to have really widened in this respect, which is a really positive thing.    Inclusion is interesting. I can only speak about being female in what can be a very male environment at times. I was told growing up, for example, that 'there's no such thing as ladies morris'.  Shanty groups tend to be male, and men tend to dominate pub sessions with loud bawdy songs. It can be tricky to infiltrate as a female.  I think it's one of the reasons I choose to sing songs from the women's point of view, the work they've done, and the lives they live - to be their voice, because history has typically been told from the man's view.   I'm conscious that the folk world tends to be very white too. I can think of one younger person who is not (Cohen Brathwaite - Kilcoyne) who is flying the flag and representation for people of colour.    I've once seen someone mocked for how they performed in a pub session. My mum spotted that they were likely autistic and spoke with them afterwards (they were). She then berated the people who'd been rude, and set them straight!  Although people can be really encouraging and lovely, I've also heard way too many adults be bitchy about other people at folk events. There's gossip, and people not speaking to others, and comments to one side, which does put me off.","I don't know sorry","Postgraduate taught degree (e.g., MA, MSc, MEng; postgraduate certificate or diploma; PGCE)",NA,"Middle class",NA,"Yes","CF11",NA,"Cornish",NA,"No religion",NA,NA,NA,"Labour Party",NA,"8","Non-organiser","White UK","Female","No","Heterosexual/Straight",47,"41-60"

Became interested in music in general via Beatles/Stones etc in early 60s, then Dylan, Donovan, Baez etc took me to Guthrie, Carter family and so on.

After many years of trying by previous teams, we have got a small coterie of young singers, who don't fit the stereotype, whom I now consider 'core' supporters at one of our two venues.Â  But we met by chance.Â  perhaps the humour, etc, I inject into MC-ing made them stick around when we occupied [legitimately, by pre-arrangement with the venue] ""their"" space, but I don't reckon they're in our club now due to my doing.","Online versions of those you list have continued beyond what you'd imagine would have been the needs met by the Pandemic.

Zooms also appeal to those to frail, or health-compromised to get out to live events.

I have a theory that most people dislike acapella singing unless it's good, which discourages learners; short attention spans, I guess. This has taught me to be very selective with subject matter and indeed where I sing. I admit I often, chicken out, if I feel the occasion isn't right. 
I also think that most pub session attendees who come along usually with a guitar often see a singer as something to endure, before they can get back to strumming. 
Pure musicians too, e.g. fiddlers can rarely listen, they get too engrossed in their own instrument to have any interest in words. I've experienced musicians deciding not to attend sessions because waiting for their turn, on a round the room event was too long. By the same token they were unwilling to play a simple chord or two as an in between verse accompaniment to an otherwise acapella song.
IMO there is definitely a divide between those who sing, and those who play and sing, however unsuccessfully that may be.","no","GSCE and equivalent (e.g., Standard grades, first certificate; ESOL, NVQ)",NA,"Working class",NA,"Yes","YO60",NA,"English",NA,"No religion",NA,NA,NA,"Conservative Party",NA,"0","Volunteer","White UK","Male","No","Heterosexual/Straight",76,"61-80+"

On a mental health front, I would describe myself as mildly-moderately socially/performance anxious, and on certain occasions leaders of a singing event have made throw-away comments & quips that weren't intended to cause a problem, but were a cause of discomfort to me as relatively new to a particular group.

While I & friends will regularly sing songs of African American, or  Traveller origins, I've not known anyone from those origins singing.
At the club I help organise we aim to keep a gender balance in our guest list & try to make it clear that anyone who wants to song or play in 'floor spots' is encouraged to do so, but my guess is that floor spots are probably something like 60-40 male to female. That might reflect overall attendance (which would raise questions in itself), but I also have the sense that in couples who come to the club, it's more common for female partners to say 'I don't sing' than male partners. On reflection, of the two clubs I belong to, I'd say that the one with a sing around format attracts more singing from women than does the one where we song from the stage - and I can think of particular women I know to be experienced singers who will generally say 'no thanks' when offered a stage-based 'floor spot'

Also, access for disabilities often means taking an extra step ie more work.

So not only do you now have to ring the number (extra work) but you are deaf so you now canâ€™t do anything. Accessible should mean â€œjust as easily accessed as everyone elseâ€ ie no extra steps, no extra work, just turn up like everyone else does and know that it will be fine.

So I sing a lot of songs about love, requited or otherwise, and songs with a neutral or happy narrative.","Origin not so much in terms of history and geography but in terms of genre.

A difference I have noticed between folk songs and say pop songs is that there is a much greater understanding that you are conveying a story or experience which is not necessarily yours - 'I is not I' - so there is a greater repertoire of song and experience available to you, and an acceptance by the audience that it is perfectly reasonable for you to be singing in the 'voice' of someone else, of a different sex or profession or country or time, for example. I appreciate that freedom of wider selection, and the ability to give or receive someone else's story.","Yes","It's often about the context and the way a song is presented; the same song can be presented appropriately or inappropriately. Sexism or racism presented humorously or unthinkingly; the former more often in storylines, the latter more often in specific words/language used. I have to say I have not really encountered this in clubs or concerts I have been at in recent years.

Somewhat differently, it is my experience that some people can assume that everyone in the room shares the same political or (non-)religious views; while this might be true to a large extent, it's not very welcoming or comfortable for those whose views might be more moderate or even be the opposite; not very inclusive. I do encounter this regularly in clubs and concerts. An individual performer, whether professional or local, is of course free to hold and express whatever beliefs and opinions they wish, within the law, but it would be less unpleasant if they considered the possibility that good-hearted people in the room might legitimately disagree with them, and consider that when they speak (and if they don't want them in the room, well, again not very inclusive). (It is often the introduction rather than the song itself.)

I have only left one, online, event early because of something that upset me (though doubtless no one else), which was someone seeming to me to take the position that Cruel Mother was a problematic song not because it was about a mother murdering her children, but because it was from a benighted time when she wasn't allowed to kill them before birth.","No","It's not nice to think that people in the room would be as hostile to you as the people they talk or sing about if they knew that you held the same particular view as the people they are talking or singing about.

I'm struggling to think of a specific example, but there are songs I've heard that I wouldn't lead owing to their content, and those I've not joined in on the chorus.

A few slightly more specific examples - a festival bar and a song from slave plantations was song. It was inappropriate because it was out of context and appeared to makr the only black person in the session uneasy. I did not sing that song.

Songs which ""celebrate"" persecution of women or prostitution make me uncomfortable. I think the distinction between these and celebrating piracy (for example) is that while piracy is an issue in the 21st century, it's less of a contemporary issue to our society.

"Respondent 505","Lead songs,Sing choruses","Folk clubs,Concerts,Singarounds,Open mic nights,Other traditional community singing (like carol singing)",NA,"3-5","43","1) It looked fun, at times (!)  I'd always sung - rock / pop /jazz - but most of my life never British folk music. (I had sung Turkish and Greek folk songs occasionally before that, in their respective countries of origin.) 2. My (older) sister used to go to folk clubs with my Dad, and they knew local musicians. I used to sing along with the records at home so I think it seeded back then and weirdly germinated much later!  3) I saw that it *could* foster a warm and very social atmosphere compared to other forms of gatherings (eg non-folk open-mic nights). However, I had been to a folk night some years before and the opposite seemed to be true of that club. 4) I went to a folk night (Royal Traditions, Dungworth) originally to see Lady Maisery in their early days, primarily for their act, as I was interested in their harmony singing and arrangements. 5) The format of that night appealed to me. I had previously experienced and loathed (and still do) the 'singaround' one-by-one format, especially as a listener who did not want to sing. The 'sing if you want to' with no circle and with jolly 'house-songs' with words available was much more conducive to my joining in and eventually singing solo and/or leading chorus songs. 
6) I had a friend from a community choir, and also a neighbour, who were long-time folkies, and they encouraged and inspired me. 
7) I am interested in many kinds of music, and I seek out any musical genres and styles to stimulate my own (non-folk) musical creativity. 
8) Mental-ill health had destroyed my confidence to sing in public, and I saw the folk singing as the best way back to that - it took a while but it worked!","Don't mind","Don't mind","Don't mind","Don't mind","To be honest I don't have much experience of other environments than Royal Traditions, Dungworth, but I would say that it is very much THE ideal folk singing environment for me. There are, however, many reasons why that is the case, which are not to do with the format. The pub, and even the layout of the pub, are factors, as are the regulars and their love of the place and the club. Interestingly, I have introduced friends to that environment, some unconfident at singing and at first new to folk music, and they have been converted. I would stress though, that there are aspects of folk singing in clubs that would be anathema to many people who are not already into folk music, and even at Royal Traditions, these would put people off. I am not suggesting that a 'true' traditional folk night should be censored or artificially tailored. However, I would dearly like to see the folk singing format of Royal Traditions and its inclusive ethos, the 'sing if you want to but no pressure', the rousing chorus house songs (which encourage more of the same), plus a live act to draw people in, replicated elsewhere with a more diverse audience and with less reliance on the breadth of the traditional (mainly white British) / folk revival / received wisdom/knowledge/folk police/'quasi-academic knowledge and memory-requirements'. I love Royal Traditions but I would propose that the format could be replicated elsewhere with four separate but not mutually exclusive suggestions. These, in addition to a traditional but innovative English folk club like Royal Traditions, would be my ideals. 1) I really believe that the format could be trialled / adapted in a suitable venue (Sheffield would be good!) to include folk music from ethnic minority groups and people who have migrated to the UK. This would need careful planning and monitoring (and an interesting set of house songs!) but I think it could be a goer. This would mean a more revolving door of house songs, and some help and transliterations of the songs, but I think that would be a fascinating project, and one which might receive funding btw :)
2) Fun. Escapism. Chorus songs. Not everyone wants to sing a solo but they will sing if there is enough noise. There is a reason why Shanties took off in the lockdowns globally, and also why the chorus songs and 'joiny-in-ones' at folk clubs are so popular. Eliza Carthy in her Twitter musings on what is folk points to community-wide songs - and what are they these days? As she points out, they are football chants and pub singalong faves, from Fairytale of New York, to (!) Delila, to Hey Jude. I was in a theatre show with Hey Jude as the last song, and you have the community singing experience. I recall a memorable theatre singalong Sound of Music too! I'm not suggesting that these should be part of the diversity as mentioned above (but come to think of it, perhaps Hey Jude would be a way of integration?) - I digress. My point here is a serious one. The solo English folk ballads, and more modern political or potentially depressing songs are important and interesting, and my suggestion above in point one would mean that such serious and 'blues' folk songs from around the world should not be discouraged. But - I often have heard songs (even at Royal Traditions) that are dreadfully depressing, and unremitting in their misogyny, their tales of murder, death, infanticide, rape, racism, colonialism, imperialism, impotence, etc, and I could go on.. I see much of this differently as a folk outsider. At a gig at which the group gleefully said 'another (the 7th?) song about death!' I turned to a fellow audience member who had also recently lost his father and said 'this is too much for me', and he agreed. I mention this also in connection with my first point above. I know someone who is a drama therapist for torture victims. Many folk songs would not be appropriate. But apart from that, I have had success with creating the jolly 'Hey Jude' atmosphere in public and elsewhere with jolly shanty and chorus songs, including the Royal Trads house songs. Jolly chorus and joiny-in songs with the words really work for all! As an ex- (TEFL/EAP) English teacher, I'd say these would work with ESL teachers who work with migrants and refugees. 
3) A folk club for all ethnicities, without any of the caveats above. Sort of contradicting myself massively, but I think it is imperative that a separate initiative should be made to capture all of the true folk music in the UK right now, whether it is jolly, trad or not. Who is archiving now? The UK of 2023 should be recorded. I'll be provocative now. You have funding, and you say you will go to Thailand and Vietnam, which I support, but do spend your funding on what is here! Who is capturing it? Who is collecting?
4) Could folk music clubs (at least to occasional city centre / Christmas sings) blend to Eliza's wide definition of folk sings? I provided song sheets for trad Derbyshire / Yorkshire carols in a local pub but mixed with well-known carols. It worked. I honestly think there is a future there. It is all folk, after all

","Yes","It was an unremittingly appalling song by a good and experienced (and female ) singer, about a rape and murder. I am not sure of the origin of the song. Perhaps relatively modern. Every second of it was appalling. A man once sung a song in tribute to, and after the death of, an American songwriter (not trad folk), which was about a horrific misogynistic murder. At the same event, the professional artist had sung a similar song earlier. Folk songs may be cathartic for some but where else could you find such depressing songs as infanticide? I recall a small village gig with a long intro by the artist about the infanticide origins of the song, and I saw a man on the front row grab his partner's hand, and I saw her stress and discomfort from several rows back. I am not saying these songs should be censored, but I want to make these points: 1) I have a friend who is a drama-therapist for people who have been tortured. These people would benefit from communal folk singing but the content should be monitored. 2) Folk can be fun and that may have to be separated from the miserable songs 3) Re this research: Perhaps there should be an experimental diversification.

I then got a guitar for Christmas, aged 12, together with Folkways songbook '104 folk songs', later I got their '124 folk songs'  I spent my teens learning and singing them - all American songs, which seemed quite unusual and quaint.  I didn't much like the English folk revival at the time (Hated Steeleye Span on TOTP).  Much later (in my 40s) I started listening to singers like Lisa Knapp and Alasdair Roberts.  I really enjoy their interpretations of traditional songs. Walking past EFDSS one day I saw a poster of a bodybuilder adorned with Morris bells, saying 'Discover Your Inner Folk', advertising the Saturday singing workshop run by Sam Lee, so I joined and got back into singing - without the guitar.

Most don't come but those that have, say they enjoyed it.  I take an old friend who comes to stay to folk gigs quite often and she seems to like it but she's not really into music that much.  She doesn't go to anything to do with folk music unless I take her.  I took my children when they were younger.  My daughter (when she was 16) took up the banjo after coming to an event at Cecil Sharp House.  She's now 27 and we went to see Jacken Elswyth/C Johns/ Mike Gangloff together recently which she really enjoyed.  But she's not so much into folk singing.

'Thorneymoor Woods' features Nottingham, so I learned it to sing at a Nottingham friend's birthday.","I like historical topics that tell us about the past but can link to the present.'Thorneymoor Woods' is about poaching, and the poachers being let off.  It's historically significant because it's what happened during the Eighteenth Century when laws known as 'The bloody code' were so draconian that people were sometimes acquitted even when guilty because the punishments seemed too harsh, or landowners were happy to turn a blind eye to a bit of poaching because people had lost access to common land.  A bit like juries acquitting people now (thinking of the Colston statue toppling).","Some songs origins are a bit baffling which make them interesting eg, Benjamin Bowmaneer - is it from the Civil War? Is it anti-semitic?  Long Lankin - what's that about? Is it something to do with leprosy?","I like songs of worker's struggles, 'A miner's life' is a modern example, or songs from 'the troubles' like Christy Moor's  'Lid of me granny's bin' I guess I connect with them as they are songs of people who are oppressed and a song is a beautiful way of expressing both the pain of oppression but also the strength in the struggles they describe.","I recently sang 'My husband's got no courage in him' 
- quite an unusual theme for a folk song, which is why I chose it.  Often I am drawn to particular songs just because certain songs just happen to suit my voice better than others.  I like songs with strong women and songs with an interesting context - I sing ''Three Gypsies came to my door"" because it ends with the women staying with her gypsy lover (as opposed to other versions where she sees her lover hanged or she finds out he's not a gypsy after all)  I like it also because it was collected by Alice Gillington who went to stay with gypsies in the New Forest, and was a bit of an outsider with the folk song collectors so there's a kind of symmetry in the story around it.","No",NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,"Yes","Sam Lee organised some positive and inclusive events at EFDSS back in 2008ish.  I can't quite remember but I think one themed for folk outsiders, and one was called 'Nowt so queer as folk' His poster with the semi naked bodybuilding Morris dancer that I mentioned earlier also encouraged me as I had thought as a lot of folk (and EFDSS)  as a bit 'staid' but things seemed to shift around that time.  EFDSS now has lots of inclusive stuff.  Accessibility for people with disabilities is a bit of a challenge in an old building with limited resources.","The folk singing community in general feels like a great big warm and diverse community. I think there might be a bit of a gap between those who frequent folk clubs who tend to be older and those who mostly go to gigs/festivals who tend to be younger, although there is a lot of crossover.  A 'club' sort of implies a closed group that you have to be a member of, so in a way it feels it's not the right term for it.  Don't know what is though.  And young people are busy discovering what they like so are probably less 'regular' in attendance at specific things.  I've noticed that lots of younger people I've met who are into folk, have got into it through their parents.  Just like the folk dynasties of Waterson/Carthy, Kerr, etc there seem to be many less famous folk 'families' around.  Also there's quite a movement around environmental/the land that seems to align with the folk ethos  - lots of folk songs about nature and the land and protest.  e.g. Right to Roam  is active about the right to camp on Dartmoor and that links back to Ewan MacColl being at the Kinder Scout mass trespass back in the day....what goes around comes around.

We have a primarily young adult age demographic, balanced gender split across attendees, 3 out of 5 organisers are women, and we run out of a queer and accessibility conscious venue.

Don't we all?","I think that the folk clubs that sprung from the so called revival in the 1960s were probably a temporary 1 to 1.5 generation phenomenon. They certainly don't have much in common with the environments in which folk song existed in the previous couple of hundred years. They worked for a particular set of social circumstances, but society has moved on more than your average folk club. Among their strengths were the importance of active participation in the music and the sense of community for the attendees. Among their weaknesses was a tendency to a certain small c conservatism in the way they continued to operate, a failure to realise how the wider public might see them.

The rise of the festivals has done much to promote the notion of professionalism amongst performers, but maybe at the same time by creating events that are in many ways similar to other professional entertainment industry events, they have not been as successful at developing active participation in singing. Their scale also tends toward focusing on bands rather than solo performers.

There is a real need for much more diversity in the ways and places that people can sing. In particular in convivial, smaller scale, inclusive, community type settings that encourage people to participate and also to practise and get better.","I don't know.

I love the emotional connection: singing rude or silly songs that make people laugh, heartbreak songs that make people cry, union songs that help people channel anger or frustration. And I also love the feeling of connection and community that comes from singing choruses together. Finally, I like how I can put it all on the line when I sing. Life is necessarily emotionally restrained, or emotions are put across in factual terms. But when you sing a song, it can be a conduit to something bigger.

I come from Norfolk and I love the wide variety of songs from the East Norfolk tradition (where my mother was born). Part of my heart is always in those flat fields and huge skies and old boys with thick accents and sly smiles. 

I also have roots in Ireland (I am quarter Irish and my mother had a very Irish upbringing in east Norfolk bizarrely), Wales (my grandmother's side of the family were born in Wales, although to a Roma father), and the Roma community (there are a few songs that draw on the gypsy experience or itinerant experience, and I also know one song in Roma - Ausvicate hi kher baro, an account of the Roma genocide which I tend to sing around Roma Genocide Memorial Day on August 2nd). Additionally, I live in Oxfordshire now. I feel personally validated and myself when I can draw on songs that reflect this.

(Sorry, I hopet hese answers aren't too longwinded and are helpful!)","It honestly varies from time to time. I might go through a period where I love shagging songs, or dark sea songs, or shanties. Recently I have been very in to Sean NÃ³s songs, and also Salsa songs (I do a lot of salsa when I'm not folking). But I can feel as of today that songs about Joe Hill and unions are coming up as my next big thing.","I am really interested in songs that are linked to particular old singers and situations. More interested than I am in modern singers, I feel like I have a more personal connection to it somehow, or I am more historically interested in bringing their experience to the present day and breathing life into those songs.","I am a socialist, a feminist, and a queer. When I'm singing political songs, it tends to draw on that. At the last singaorund I did, I sang a song about the hardships and dangers of mining, as a small example (Going to the Mine by Johnny Handle, which has beautifully poetic words too, some of the finest I know).","I think we've covered it. Beautiful melodies that fit well on my voice and I feel I can be expressive with, beautiful and/or striking words (either poetic or simple and effective). A compelling story. Ridiculousness and farce, or winkingly naughty content that everyone will chuckle at. Songs that help everyone feel together with a nice singalong chorus.

And finally, songs that I've really engaged with the source singer or text and I'm excited to share.","Yes","There are multiple songs out there, especially in the shanty world, that express racism, sexism, shaming women or sex workers, colonial narratives, non-consent and so on, that I find uncomfortable at best or offensive at worst. I sing sometimes with a feminist shanty group who advocate changing, omitting, or casting in an ironic light to get around this.","No","It makes me determined to set up a better culture at my own sessions. For the tradition to survive and grow, you can't have a situation where someone who feels part of it gets made to feel uncomfortable and leaves, or someone who's never heard folk singing before could walk in on a session and the first thing they hear is a bunch of nonsense about whores - they'd never come back, and that's the opposite of what we need.","No",NA,"Yes","As mentioned, changing the songs to make them more inclusive by swapping pronouns, rewriting, omitting, using irony etc.","I think the communities formed by folk singing are really special. One interesting observation I've had though is that the folk club mc'ed open session format, which involves getting up in front of people, seems to be unpopular with younger singers now, who prefer a pub. 

I also think folk singing is becoming really imperiled by the available venues. It's so hard to find a good quiet space where everyone can be heard. Small pubs don't cut it but community centres don't have a vibe that people want to come back for, they're often just too big. Community pubs in cities are also few and far between thanks to the monster breweries.","Well Oxford's feminist shanty group Auntie Shanty for one, that's the feminist one I mentioned (and the only session in the city that has been woman-led since its inception in 2017, although I (he/they) have stood in once or twice. I think the approach to singing at the Bastard English session might interest you too - it is also MCed but is far more popular than folk club, it's hugely popular actually.

When I grew older it was a bonding point for me and my dad, talking about the stories behind the songs he sung. We would them go to folk club together when I was 16/17 and sing and play together - going out most nights to folk clubs around the country. I have always been interested in writing and stories and I love the niche regional history that comes with folk music.

Somewhere that has respect for the artists, even if it is just a sing around. I like the trad ideas of not walking in once someone has started a song, staying off your phone and not talking.

I like it to be structured - I hate the â€˜jump inâ€™ singarounds as it doesnâ€™t encourage those that might not have the confidence to join in.

Niche history of mines is always good, though. Act Of God - Peter Bond describes the mining disaster in Silkston where a flood killed children in a mine that were working naked with the men there. They pushed the mines doors open to get out and the water flushed them to the bottom of the mine and they drowned. They blamed an act of god and no compensation was paid. Queen Victoria didnâ€™t like that they were naked so enforced that people needed to wear clothes thereafter. I love songs like this that have loads to unpick from poor working conditions to terrible decisions made on the owners part.","Folk is very socialist - in my opinion. Itâ€™s about the roots of working class people, and can feel really empowering. I like that lots of it punches upwards to those in power. It feels like a voice for those that might otherwise not have one.","A lot of my favourite songs are just really powerful. In Act of God, Peter Bond writes the line â€˜still Rachel for her children pines, she knows not why they fell from graceâ€™. I adore English and the use of language and the decisions writers make to chose certain words always interests me. Mourns would have been a good word to use but â€˜pinesâ€™ is so much more full of yearning and heartbreak. 
Me and my band sing I Once Loved A Lass because it was the first song I learnt to sing and play with my dad and I will always sing it because it feels like home, like me and my dad. I remember us bent hunched over a computer and finding another verse we had never heard and just looking at each other like â€˜yeah, the song makes more sense with that verse in, letâ€™s add itâ€™. 
Morley Main also brings great memories of being with my dad and taking part in saltburnâ€™s signing competition they used to do - and beating him haha. 
Unicorns by bill caddick was the most complicated song, guitar wise, that my dad showed me to play and Iâ€™m really proud of it to this day. 
Bold Poachers is played in a double drop tuning. A fab story of the only time in history two people were hanged for the same crime.

Because we had guitars we stayed at one end of the room where was comfortable for us and our instruments and out of the way of anyone else. The people that were running the session told us they would need to sit where we were (despite us being the only people there) meaning we had to go to end of a room with sofas so we couldnâ€™t sit and play comfortably with each other and as the room got more full we felt like we were taking up space. The people that ran the session then cherry picked the people they knew to play and after about 2 hours of being really uncomfortable we just left. We noticed there was one young girl in the corner that we felt should have really been encouraged to sing as she was bringing the average age of the room down by about 50 years but she was ignored while we were there. We were frustrated that those running the show sang unaccompanied and could really have run the session from anywhere in the room. 
There are definite cliques within the folk community but we like to think these are few and far between. 
I played a hiring fair with my dad one year that we didnâ€™t win (not saying that we should have, there was loads of really good talent!). However, when we returned the year after (to his credit) one of the judges came to see me and apologised for not putting us through as he thought I was â€˜too young and wouldnâ€™t stick it outâ€™. Quite funny as I had been singing and playing with my dad for about three years at that point ha - so that was a barrier I never saw coming!

Personally, I like the opportunity it has given us to overtly presence queerness in a current and historical context","Yes","At Falmouth shanty festival this weekend, it was odd to hear the songs about prostitutes and the songs that aren't entirely right-on racially still sung. To some degree it doesn't bother me because I'm resilient and believe that its mostly done with good intent, but I must say I felt pretty jolted by the idea that it's totally ok to sing about getting the pox from prostitutes in Valparaiso given the broader context that we all know about poverty and sex work and colonialism. Likewise, other such songs. Another amusing song about Betty Stoggs (sponsoring beer, Cornish character, played to great amusement in pantomime dame style) might well have made trans friends uncomfortable. Again, I'm believing in its good intent and it's a tradition in itself, but I do think it betrays a lack of thought sometimes.",NA,"Well, for the big stage farewell at Falmouth it made us feel very much the odd ones out; and that our mission was a necessary one.

My barrier is from folk activity - dancing and singing at school but that was some time ago since I'm 45. It left me with a perception that folk is very male, and/or heteronormative. As a kid, it was made clear that if I wanted to participate in folk activity I would have to dress like the girl I was - tomboys couldn't be, and girls couldn't do the boys' parts. I don't think that would be the case now - least I hope not. BUT in the early days of our choir a young woman said - oh no a soprano couldn't lead on X shanty. We were all bit shocked - like - you missed the whole point of this group kid.

I enjoy songs that engage with local or national identity, whether it's with presentation of a local legend or wildlife, or it's questioning what makes somebody a ""Midlander"", or English, or British, or European - in a way that encourages further thought, debate, and hopefully compassion. And I'm interested in hearing songs from all over the world.","Again, really depends on how I'm feeling. I particularly look for songs that feature female agency - stories that centre women and girls, and their freedom to think, speak and act.","16th and 17th century music is the focus of my academic research, so anything from that rough time bracket, but it depends - I'll go later too! I'm interested in songs with variant versions, songs with clear community histories, and songs with origins in female writing and performance.","Any song that encourages people to step outside of their echo chamber and increasingly polarised stance to listen to other people interests, above all in the name of inclusivity. I'm a left-wing Remainer feminist LGBTQiA ally, with ADHD: pro-choice, antiracist, deeply worried about the climate and about mutual social responsibility. So I'll connect with all that! And especially anybody who sings about how godawful the Tories are.","As a performer, I either pick songs I don't think people will have heard before, or ones with great singalong bits, for a good connection. I like things with unusual melodies and rhythms, or beautiful language, as they're memorable and fun to sing. I prefer songs with some decent female agency so I can find those stories and draw them out. I'm drawn to songs where the natural world or magic play a part, because I like the magic inherent in storytelling and I love the natural way can be depicted in folk. I also like rude, funny and generally irreverent songs, the older the better - just to show people haven't changed all that much. I like songs that get strong emotional reactions, that give you catharsis through music. And I like songs that are you want to be a better person.","Yes","Less the songs themselves more the performance context, reactions or side comments - particularly songs involving harassment. Hearing a particularly harsh version of the Two Magicians where all the men cheered at the end (plus jokes in between verses) wasn't great. I see enough actual harrassment taking place day to day, I don't want people feeling empowered or having it normalised by folk singing experiences.

I appreciate that it's very difficult to police audience behaviour, but I don't think the performers were asked to stop encouraging the behaviour","As a woman performing in her 20s and early 30s, I have had relatively few problematic experiences, but quite a few have stemmed from folk singing environments dominated by older men, where some of them are convinced that they know much more about the genre and how to perform, and that they need to give me unsolicited advice (sometimes quite aggressively, verbally). I'm not sure what the solutions to this might be on a bigger scale, but I know I'm not the only person to experience this fairly regularly.

Personally speaking, and as someone who experiences extreme social anxiety, the cliquey nature of the English folk scene is hell-like for me and I have only experienced glimmers of positive experience since I started singing 20 years ago. I spent much of my short professional career in my late teens and early twenties being the subject of bullying/gossiping by certain dominating figureheads (artists and promoters) which totally destroyed my mental health and my career as a young female folk singer. I found Scottish musicians and promoters to generally be much friendlier and inclusive but I probably will never know why I was received the way I was by the English folk scene.

It is good that universities recognise 'folk' in research and study and is leading to some excellent performers and performances now.

The host is like the teacher, who initiates all actions and has final say. The participants are like students who have accepted a specific level of skill as theirs, ie there is little progression of skill. The songs never vary in expression and new ones are rarely added. Envy of skill isn't hidden, and 'banter' is frequently critical. There is a social structure that is rarely challenged; they sing or play in strict rotation and the preference is always for songs that everyone can join in the chorus. They are often pedants about the music's source and expression. This drives off new members.

There is another type who prefers only very specific folk performers, groups or subgenres. They often have only a few 'party pieces' and these are performed without interest, skill or pleasure. I call them folking zombies, as they appear to be a bit 'dead' - there for limited social interaction and not actually sharing a musical experience.

Another reason is that your voice changes as you age ( mine has gone deeper) so different songs now suit me.","Yes","Mostly the overtly political ( and usually lengthy) introduction.

My friend has just in last year held monthly folk song (chorus) sessions with word sheets, for non-folkies who said they wanted to join in more and who were fearful of harmonies. Unfortunately the hope was to wean people off the word sheets and off the dependance on organiser and gain more song leaders in this safe space. Biggest one had nearly 40 present.
Without strong leadership (me or my friend), it does not happen.
